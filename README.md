This is a pretend mock up webpage for a hotel that shows a map of sponsored activites in downtown Moab. This mock up uses Google Maps and Foursquare API's as well as Knockout.js and Bootstrap for a dynamic list of links and styling.

The webpage is designed to render in an organized layout on both desktops and mobile phones. A user can search for locations in real time with the help of knockout.js. A user can also filter the type of locations with filter boxes located in the nav bar. If the API fails to retrieve the data within 5 seconds, a prompt will show on the page to display the failure while the rest of the page will load.

To load the page, download the entire file then open the index.html file with your chosen internet provider.
